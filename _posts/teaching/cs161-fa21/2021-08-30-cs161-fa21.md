Hey! I'll be using this page to post resources from my 161 Discussion Section for **Fall 2021.**

I'd appreciate your feedback! If you have any thoughts on my section, please fill out [this anonymous form](https://airtable.com/shr762qgTwjZPiTtE) - or, shoot me an email (shomil@).

If I haven't posted slides for the most recent discussion yet, feel free to view my slides from previous semesters. For the most part, they should be similar!

### Discussion Resources

**Also, here's my [Final Review Sheet](https://shomil.me/assets/pdf/161/final.pdf) from Spring 2020. Disclaimer: I made this when I took this class and haven't really looked at it since, so there might be a typo or two! It also might not fully encapsulate the scope of this semester's final.**
