Hey! I'll be using this page to post resources from my 161 Discussion Section for **Fall 2021.**

I'd appreciate your feedback! If you have any thoughts on my section, please fill out [this anonymous form](https://airtable.com/shr762qgTwjZPiTtE) - or, shoot me an email (shomil@).

If I haven't posted slides for the most recent discussion yet, feel free to view my slides from previous semesters. For the most part, they should be similar!
