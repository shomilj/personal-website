### SECURITY PRINCIPLES.

1. Security is economics.
2. Principle of Least Privilege (limit exposure in the case of a breach).
3. Use fail-safe defaults (deny access by default, allow selectively).
4. Separation of responsibility (require several parties to work together).
5. Defense in depth (use redundant protection).
6. Psychological acceptability (users should buy into security model).
7. Human factors matter (people become numb to security if it bothers them).
8. Ensure complete mediation (Check every access to every object).
9. Know your threat model (original assumptions may have changed over time).
10. Detect if you can’t prevent.
11. Don’t rely on security through obscurity.
12. Design security from the start.
13. Conservative design (evaluate systems by looking at worst-case scenarios).
14. Kerkhoff’s principle/Shannon’s maxim (the enemy knows the system)
15. Proactively study attacks.



### **SYSTEM DESIGN**

**Trusted Computing Base:** a part of a system that we rely upon to operate correctly if the system is to be secure. If it fails, the system’s security is compromised. Examples: root user on linux, internal network protected by a firewall.

**Access Control:** a set of rules that limit access to a system.

**Reference Monitor:** a mechanism that ensures that access control policy is followed (TCB for access control). 

**TCB Design Principles:** Unbypassable, tamper-resistant, and verifiable. Keep it small and simple. Move as much code outside the TCB as possible.

**Benefits of TCB:** We can focus security attention on a small part of a system, instead of trying to protect the whole thing.

**Privilege Separation:** Split up software architecture into multiple modules, some privileged and others unprivileged. 

**TOCTTOU Vulnerabilities [Time of Check to Time of Use]**: Attackers can run code in parallel to bypass conditional cases.

**Example of TOCTTOU:**

### Memory Safety

**X86 Review**

Important Registers: **EBP** (base pointer) & **ESP** (stack pointer).

The stack grows down, towards lower addresses, by decrementing **ESP**.

**EIP**/**EBP** are registers, hold active instruction pointer and base pointer.

**ESP** is a register that points to the top of the stack.

**RIP**/**SFP** are spots on the stack that store saved versions of these values.

On a function call, **EIP**/**EBP** are copied onto the stack and labeled RIP/SFP.

##### **Function Prologue:**

```assembly
push %ebp			# Save the top of the previous frame.
mov %esp %ebp	# Start the new frame by moving EBP down to ESP.
sub X %esp		# X = size of local variables (grow stack).
```

##### Function Epilogue

```assembly
add X %esp	#Sometimes “mov %ebp %esp”
pop %ebp
ret					# Pops return address from stack, goes there.
```

##### Function Calling Convention:

Push parameters onto stack; call function; save/update %ebp; save CPU registers for temps; allocate local variables; perform function’s purpose; release local storage; restore saved registers; restore old base pointer; return from function (go to RIP); clean up pushed parameters.



### BUFFER OVERFLOW VULNERABILITIES.

C doesn’t have any bounds checking; thus, we can intentionally access/write to memory that’s out-of-bounds, changing values, function pointers, and more.

**Malicious Code Injection Attack:** transfer execution to malicious code (could be stored in buffer, or elsewhere in program).

**Stack Smashing**: write past the end of a buffer and change the RIP [return instruction pointer]. On function return, execution will jump to new RIP.

**Stack Canaries:** a defense against stack smashing. A randomly generated value stored right after the RIP/SFP. Function epilogue checks value of canary against stored value. Bypasses: learn value of canary + overwrite with self, overflow in heap, overwrite fn pointer on stack, random-access write past canary.

**Format String Vulnerabilities:** 

- “%x:%x” reveals the contents of the function’s stack frame.

- “%s” treats the next word of stack memory as an address, prints it as string.

- “%100c” prints 100 characters.

- “%n” allows overwriting arbitrary addresses.

- “%x:%s” treats next word as address, prints word after that as string.

  ```c
  // If buf contains % chars, printf will look for args
  printf(buf);
  
  // buf is safely encoded.
  printf(“%s”, buf);
  ```



**Integer Conversion Vulnerabilities:** attackers can take advantage of signed => unsigned implicit integer casting to bypass conditional checks on sizes.

![image-20200625173134784](/Users/shomil/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/image-20200625173134784.png)



In the example above, the stack looks like this:

```
(bottom of mem) [buffer2] [buffer1] [sfp] [ret] [a] [b] [c] (top of mem)
```

We’ve added 12 to the address of buffer1 and changed the value at that location by 8 (thus changing the return instruction pointer).

**DEFENSES AGAINST MEMORY SAFETY VULNERABILITIES.**

- - Secure coding practices (runtime bounds checking).
  - Better languages/libraries.
  - Runtime checking.
  - Static analysis.
  - Testing (random inputs, mutated inputs, structure-driven input generation)
  - Defensive programming (each module takes responsibility for validating inputs)

**DEP (W^X)**

- To defend against code execution, we can mark writeable pages as non-executable (NX bit = writeable, not executable).
- **Return-Oriented Programming** find short code fragments (gadgets) that, when called together in sequence, execute the desired function.
- **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)** randomizes the location of everything in memory.
- To bypass ASLR + DEP, attacker needs to be able to read memory, then create a ROP chain, then write memory. 

### Precondition/Postcondition Checking

```c
/* requires p != NULL */
int deref(int *p) { 
  return *p; 
}

/* ensures: retval != NULL */
void *mymalloc(size_t n) { 
  void *p = malloc(n); 
  if (!p) { 
    perror(“Malloc”); 
    exit; 
  } 
  return p; 
}

int sum(int a[], size_t n) { 
  int total = 0;
  for (size_t i=0; i < n; i++) {
    /* requires: a != NULL && 0 <= i && i < size(a) */ 
    total += a[i];
  }
	return total;
}
```
