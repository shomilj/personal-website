description: A visual analysis of admissions at UC Berkeley.
---

In this article, I present a variety of visualizations containing demographic data from the incoming Freshman Class of 2024 at UC Berkeley studying EECS or L&S CS (Intended). All of these visualizations are interactive, so feel free to click around! Note that this project is in progress, so some of these links might stop working and new links may be added at any time.

When viewing visualizations, pay close attention to the red/blue color scale on the right side.

##### Demographic Overview

These two visuals contain a full demographic overview of the class of 2024. The breakdown is ordered as follows: Resident Status, Gender, Ethnicity, Reported Family Income, and First Generation College Student (Yes or No).

##### Specific Breakdowns in the EECS/CS Class of 2024

[Gender Diversity](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_gender_diversity.html) - The incoming class is ~71% Male and ~25% Female.

[Ethnic Diversity](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_ethnic_diversity.html) - The incoming class is ~20% Chinese, 18% South Asian, 13% Mexican American/Chicano, etc...

[Joint Gender/Ethnic Diversity - Colored by Counts](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_ethnic_gender_diversity.html) - The largest demographic in the incoming class is Asian males at ~37%, and the smallest is African American females at 1.16%.

[Joint Gender/Ethnic Diversity - Colored by Admission Rates](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_ethnic_gender_diversity_-_admission_rates.html) - This is the same graph as above, but colored in a slightly different way. The shading here represents admission rates; notice the inverse relationship in box size & admission rate. 

[Income/Ethnic Breakdown](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_income_ethnic_breakdown.html) - The relationships between income and ethnicity here mirror larger societal inequalities in the State of California and country/world in general. 

[High School Background (Public vs. Private) and Ethnicity Breakdown](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024_eecs_cs__ethnic_high_school_type_breakdown.html) - Note how some ethnicities have sizeable amounts of individuals coming from private schools (ex: South Asian), whereas other demographics have very, very few (or none) coming from private school backgrounds.
