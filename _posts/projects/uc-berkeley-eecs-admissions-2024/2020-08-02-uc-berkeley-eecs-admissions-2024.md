In this article, I present a variety of visualizations containing demographic data from the incoming Freshman Class of 2024 at UC Berkeley studying EECS or L&S CS (Intended). All of these visualizations are interactive, so feel free to click around! Note that this project is in progress, so some of these links might stop working and new links may be added at any time.
