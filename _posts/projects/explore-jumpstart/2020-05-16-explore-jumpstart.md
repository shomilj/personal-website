description: An exploration of data scraped from the college recruiting platform Jumpstart.

Jumpstart is a recruiting platform tailored towards college students and recent college grads that's been rapidly growing over the past few years. Below, I've attached four interesting visualizations that I put together from the data!

I've released my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/shomilj/Explore-Jumpstart) â€“ though you'll need to write your own data scraping module if you're looking to acquire access to the dataset!
