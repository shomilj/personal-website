This article contains a variety of different visualizations of admissions at UC Berkeley. All of these visualizations are interactive, so feel free to click around! Note that this project is in progress, so some of these links might stop working and new links may be added at any time.

# Diversity in the L&S CS + EECS Class of 2024

The following visualizations are filtered to **students who have SIR'ed // committed to UC Berkeley** â€“ in other words, this Fall's freshman class. All visualizations except the first one treat L&S and EECS as one group.

Pay close attention to the red/blue scale on the right side, and the populations that fall into both extremes. 

#### Demographic Overview

These two visuals contain a full demographic overview of the class of 2024.

[Full Class of 2024 Demographic Breakdown (Colored by Counts)](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__full_funnel__color_by_count_.html)

[Full Class of 2024 Demographic Breakdown (Colored by Admission Rates)](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__full_funnel__color_by_admission_rate_.html)

#### Specific Breakdowns

[Gender Diversity](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_gender_diversity.html) - The incoming class is ~71% Male and ~25% Female.

[Ethnic Diversity](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_ethnic_diversity.html) - The incoming class is ~20% Chinese, 18% South Asian, 13% Mexican American/Chicano, etc...

[Joint Gender/Ethnic Diversity - Colored by Counts](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_ethnic_gender_diversity.html) - The largest demographic in the incoming class is Asian males at ~37%, and the smallest is African American females at 1.16%.

[Joint Gender/Ethnic Diversity - Colored by Admission Rates](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_ethnic_gender_diversity_-_admission_rates.html) - This is the same graph as above, but colored in a slightly different way. The shading here represents admission rates; notice the inverse relationship in box size & admission rate. 

[Income/Ethnic Breakdown](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_cs_income_ethnic_breakdown.html) - The relationships between income and ethnicity here mirror larger societal inequalities in the State of California and country/world in general. 

[High School Background (Public vs. Private) and Ethnicity Breakdown](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__ethnic_high_school_type_breakdown.html) - Note how some ethnicities have sizeable amounts of individuals coming from private schools (ex: South Asian), whereas other demographics have very, very few (or none) coming from private school backgrounds.

#### EECS vs. L&S - Gender Diversity

[Comparing EECS vs. L&S Gender Diversity](../../../assets/html/admissions/uc_berkeley_class_of_2024__eecs_vs._l&s_gender_diversity.html) - Think about this in the context of the rush to declare & stigmas around engineering in general.

Note the demopgrahic shifts (and how particular majors have shifted to be more impacted than others) from the year 2000 to this latest application cycle!
