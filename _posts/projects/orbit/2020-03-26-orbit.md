### High School

The origins of this project lie in the apps that I made for my high school, way back in 2017-18 - the LG CATS [iOS](https://github.com/shomilj/LGHS-iOS) and [Android](https://github.com/shomilj/LGHS-Android) apps.  Back then, my goal was simple: to create iOS and Android apps for my high school, with features like a digital Student ID card, daily announcements, club lists, and quick access to our grading portal. [Here's an archived review page that contains screenshots of what the original apps looked like](https://appadvice.com/app/the-old-los-gatos-app/1004047426).

Thinking back to then, when I was creating these apps for the first time, I had no idea what backend databases were or how to use them - but I remember searching for a simple way to manage and deliver content remotely. I settled on a combination of Wordpress (e.g. [daily announcements](https://github.com/shomilj/LGHS-iOS/blob/master/LG%20CATS/All%20Code/Daily%20Announcements/DailyAnnouncementsVC.swift)) and Google Sheets (for club lists & other resources). Instead of making a database call or hitting an API endpoint, I downloaded & parsed the direct download link to a public Google Sheet containing the data I wanted to use in the app.

At the end of Junior year in high school, I discovered Firebase's Realtime Database - and it felt like an incredible breakthrough. I didn't have to worry about someone corrupting the state/formatting of the sheet, since there was now a layer of indirection between my content management system & my database.

(Unfortunately, I also didn't know what version control was until 12th Grade - so the oldest code I still have in my archives is from the version I rewrote in 12th Grade.)

### College

When I graduated high school, I remember thinking: if I wanted to make an app like this for Berkeley, how hard would it be?

In my freshman year, I joined the Mobile Developers of Berkeley - and with a team of other developers, launched [Bear Central](https://shomil.me/bear-central/) ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-central/id1441903611), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mobiledevsberkeley.theberkeleyappandroid&hl=en_US)) - a revamped version of the original platform I designed for my high school. We built this by cloning my high school repository, applying search/replace techniques to "Los Gatos High" and "UC Berkeley", and adding a handful of Berkeley-specific features, like the Safety Toolkit feature. It took us around the course of a semester (Fall 2018) to build this out on iOS and Android.

The following semester, as I was working on tweaking & improving the feature set of Bear Central, I begin abstracting away more and more customization to the backend, mostly for my own sanity (it took me ~4 hours to deploy a build to the App Store, but 5 minutes to update data in Google Sheets/Airtable/Firestore). That same semester, through FreeVentures (an on-campus startup incubator), I explored using the framework I had created as a [no-code internal tool for businesses](https://getorbit.app). At this point, migrating from the LG CATS to Bear Central on Orbit would take ~30 minutes, as opposed to one semester - all it took was replacing the data source & adjusting the feature set in the Google Sheet.

In late Spring 2019, I learned about [Glide Apps](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/12256) - a young, Y Combinator backed startup that had a nearly identical offering, with the tagline: "Build an app from a Google Sheet in five minutes." Consequently, I put this project aside & focused on school for a few months.
